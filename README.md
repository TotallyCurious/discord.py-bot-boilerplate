# discord.py-bot-boilerplate

This is a pretty basic boilerplate for discord.py bot. It features two example cogs as well.

The bot token should be placed in a `.env` file in this format: 

`BOT_TOKEN = <PLACE_TOKEN_HERE>`

This template was heavily inspired by the neat and tidy code for [TryHackMe's discord bot](https://github.com/thm-community/thm-discord-bot/).
